From now on make sure you will use this openai api logic
This is the new way how it works.

    # Initialize the OpenAI client
    client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))   

    #completion 

    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=messages
    )

    # Extract the response
    assistant_response = completion.choices[0].message.content
